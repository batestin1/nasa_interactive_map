>> <h3> Description </h3>

<p> In this project we will explore visualizations from geolocation data
provided by NASA.
Visualizations are interactive and connected to the Big Data infrastructure.

Data is stored in HDFS and we have Spark or Map Reduce, HBASE and express.js (+ npm hbase) java.

The datasets we can use are:

- Geolocated world cities with their populations
- NASA satellite readings showing ground level (height) around the world. These data were taken from the site http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/.
- Various GPS positions obtained by the community of Open-StreetMap users. http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.gpx </p>

>> <h3> Solution </h3>
